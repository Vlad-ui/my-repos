# my-repos
my repository 1
Task 1 - Case Study QA Test Qantas.docx and Task 2  files - code and results for
         UI Automation and API Automation 

For UI Automation I've created 2 versions - 1st SeleniumUI.Java  using data driven approach in there.

2nd version SeleniumUI2.java using url as parameters to run multiple test cases with different data   
(2 test cases used - example)

All tested/executed in Eclipse Neon using Java & JUnit Framework

For  API Automation  - getRequest.java I am using 
data driven approach where number of URL (example of 2) could be tested in HTTP Get request
and response is parsed.

I put as example 2 the same test cases to drive the code and demonstrated a performance approach as well.
(could be used in test cases Assert/AssertTrue to evaluate result as well)

Also I did fetch data from .csv fles for real API Automation processes (other projects) even connecting to different servers, 
some of them running Unix/Linux and Different Databases (SOAPUI/Java).

I've used  jasonplaceholder URL for  API Automation instead of weatherbit which is not working on some step.

And I've used Google URL for UI Automation because had also problems with Service NSW
